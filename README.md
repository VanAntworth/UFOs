Used Javascript to create a web app. 


For this final assignement after creating the web app for Dana - JavaScript was used to create more table filters. In addition to the date filter - filters for the city, state, country, and shape were added. Javascript forloop (forEach) was created to filter data.

## Getting Started - Module (lead up to Final)
We initially created the web app to share information abou a topic that our commisioner Dana was passionate about( UFOs ). We then went in to make the web app much more dynamic and themeful - using Javascript and Html as well as css and bootstrap to add to the theme/look/aestheic.


## Summary 

Using Javasript and bootstrap was a great way to show off json data and create interest in a topic. The topic being UFO sightings.

### Additional Recommendations:
Change the date filter to filter month of a year instead of an exact date only.
Most or all of the data collected is from the US so the country filter seems unnecessary.
Lastly, having a drop down for shapes may be more helpful than typing one in.
